6. Read the notebooks in [3_Pandas](https://github.com/Heldenkombinat/Tutorials/tree/master/Data-Analysis/3_Pandas).
7. Read the notebooks in [4_Matplotlib](https://github.com/Heldenkombinat/Tutorials/tree/master/Data-Analysis/4_Matplotlib).
8. Read the notebooks in [5_Linear-regression](https://github.com/Heldenkombinat/Tutorials/tree/master/Data-Analysis/5_Linear-regression).
9. Repeat the analysis in [5_Linear-regression/4a_multiple-linear-regression](https://github.com/Heldenkombinat/Tutorials/blob/master/Data-Analysis/5_Linear-regression/4a_multiple-linear-regression_housing.ipynb) with your own dataset. You can find free datasets with link `5` in the `Additional resources` section below. Write all the course exercises in a **Jupyter notebook** and send the file to your tutor for review.
