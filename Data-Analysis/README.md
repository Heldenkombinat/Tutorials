# Learning from home
1. Instal the required libraries for the course (package `1` from the `Installation` section below).
2. Learn how to clone this GitHub repo (videos `1` and `2` in the `Additional resources` section below).
3. Learn the basics of Python (video `3` in the `Additional resources` section below). Write all the course exercises in a **Jupyter notebook** and send the file the tutor for review.
4. Revview the content of all notebooks in [5_Linear-regression](https://github.com/Heldenkombinat/Tutorials/tree/master/Data-Analysis/5_Linear-regression).
5. Repeat the analysis of [5_Linear-regression/4a_multiple-linear-regression](https://github.com/Heldenkombinat/Tutorials/blob/master/Data-Analysis/5_Linear-regression/4a_multiple-linear-regression_housing.ipynb) with your own dataset. You can find free datasets with link `5` in the `Additional resources` section below. Write all the course exercises in a **Jupyter notebook** and send the file the tutor for review.
